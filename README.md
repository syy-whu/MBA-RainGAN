# MBA-RainGAN

This is the PyTorch implementation for our paper: **MBA-RainGAN: A Multi-Branch Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Mixture of Rain Removal**

Download the RainCityscapes++ training and validation images from [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/19tPWnuxoaCHzLZU5e7TFIg). The extracting code is jpqg.

The code is coming soon.
